Monitoring: 

1. Application Monitoring
- Monitoring of applications
- Custom telemetry
- Process metrics : CPU, Network, IO

- Custom metrics (e.g. node, python, c#)

2. Infrastructure monitoring - Most important!
- Node Exporter
- Runs on every compute instance of your k8s cluster
- Find CPU, Memory, Network bottlenecks.
 

3. Kubernetes monitoring
- kube-state-metrics (pod/cpu/memory/network)
- API Server (CrashLoopback, etc.)
- kubelet (containers and nodes)

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Don't just helm install repo for a monitoring solution. 
Need to UNDERSTAND all the components. 
i.e. Why do I need to monitor the kublet? 
You don't just break your monitoring solution when you upgrade your cluster. 

Strategy: 
1. Deep level understanding of all components. 
2. Break components out and deploy seperately
store your deployment as IAC in Git. If the code changes, you are safe. 
3. Maintain your level of understanding. Just because you understand today, doesn't 
mean you will always understan. 

4. Do NOT do in-place cluster upgrades. 
Deploy a cluster every time you implement a change. 
a. Deploy New cluster
b. Infra as code - deployment
c. New Prometheus code
d. Test
e. Then you can apply to your cluster?
